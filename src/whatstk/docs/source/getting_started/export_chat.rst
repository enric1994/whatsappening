Export a WhatsApp chat
======================

Exporting a WhatsApp chat can be easily done from your Android or iOS device. It is done on a chat basis, so if you want
to export several chats you will have to export them individually. **When exporting, make sure to select the chats Without Media option**. Once generated, you can send it via mail, so you
can save it in your computer.

Android
--------
The export on Android might include several files. We are only interested in the text file (i.e. ``txt`` extension
file).

your computer.
